Slides from talk given on Wednesay 9, 2018 at the Denver Java Users Meetup Group.

> Spring 5 and Project Reactor

>This talk, by Geoff Filippi, will start with an introduction to reactive programming. We will introduce the Reactive Manifesto and explain Non-blocking IO. We will look at some of the new reactive programming features in Java like CompletableFuture and Reactive Streams. Project Reactor, Spring 5 and Spring Boot 2 are helping to make these new features accessible to Java developers. We will also introduce the concept of backpressure to control the flow of data.

You will learn how to create a Non-blocking application using Spring Boot 2. We will use start.spring.io to create a new Reactive application. Will will compare the Flux and Mono types and discuss when to use each.
